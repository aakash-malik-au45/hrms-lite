# HRMS Lite – Full Stack Assignment

HRMS Lite is a lightweight Human Resource Management System built as part of a full-stack coding assignment.

The application allows an admin to:

- Manage employees (add, view, delete)
- Track daily attendance
- View attendance history
- See a dashboard summary of today’s workforce status

The focus of the project is clean architecture, RESTful APIs, database persistence, validation, and a usable production-style interface.
